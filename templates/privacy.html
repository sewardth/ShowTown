    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>ShowTown LLC (“ShowTown”) welcomes casual browsers, performers, owners and managers of entertainment venues, and others who may choose to access www.showtown.co and other entertainment Sites we may offer to our community, all of whom we will refer to herein as ‘you,’ ‘User’ or ‘Users.’</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy supplements the User Terms and Conditions that can be found on our website. We reserve the right to change this policy from time to time and encourage you to check for revisions.</p>
    <p>We value your privacy, and we want you, the User, to know what information we collect on our Sites (“Site” or “Sites”) and what we do with it.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy please contact our User Services group via email at info@showtown.co</p>
    <p><strong>Specific Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>We have several areas where Users can submit information to us regarding their entertainment and performance interests, offerings, and concerns, and we also reserve the right to automatically collect certain information from Users, relating to browsing habits, preferences and other behaviors you may exhibit online.</p>
    <p>* Browsing the Site. If you are simply browsing our Site, you will not be required to register or provide any other personal data. We may track a given User’s browsing behaviors on our Site on a non-personally identifiable basis, for our own internal use, or to share with selected third parties.</p>
    <p>* Registration, Services. Users must register to participate as an entertainment venue, artist or fan, participate in competitions, post content on our Site(s) or otherwise benefit from ShowTown’s services. Where we collect data on individuals or businesses that might include personal information, ie names, phone numbers, emails, music interests, etc., we generally do not make use of this information for any purpose outside of ShowTown’s stated mission of enhancing relations among entertainers, venues and fans. We will not disclose that information to third parties without first requesting permission from Users to do so.</p>
    <p>* Outgoing Communications and Mailing Lists. In order to keep members of our entertainment communities informed about matters of specific interest, we may send e- mails and announcements to email addresses Users provided to us upon registration. Users may opt out of such activity by making a request to User Services at info@showtown.co.</p>
    <p>* Community Features. We may offer community features designed to help members learn about, experience and share interesting entertainment sources, products or services. This activity may bring a User in contact with third parties not subject to ShowTown’s control. ShowTown will assume no liability for another individual or commerce provider’s act of collecting or sharing any information about any User in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.</p><p><strong>Automatic Data Collection</strong></p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Site. As you browse our website(s) and as User uses any of the provided Services, we may track your movement through the Site through our web logs. We may gather information such as date, time, connection speed and IP address of Users. We will only use this data, if at all, on an aggregated basis with that of other users to enhance our Services and for general business purposes such as Site analysis and ad sales.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Cookies. We use cookies for several purposes. We use what are commonly called "session" cookies, meaning that they only last as long as a particular User is online. We use these cookies to identify a User as a valid participant so that we can deliver relevant information, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer and to help us personalize Users’ service experience based on registration preferences.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions, competitions or surveys that we provide. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As part of the sign-in process for our services provided to registered Users, we may also use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies, which stay with Users after a given session is over and that User is offline. We may use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows Users to retain member names and passwords so that upon the next log in, these fields will be pre-populated.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We may sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology such as web beacons within the promotional messages that we send to Users.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">These technologies help us to track, for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a band competition. The generated information is related to non-personally identifying customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the activity and User flows within our service or Sites. These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking. Such tracking would track an individual User’s movements but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal analysis by ShowTown to improve the service.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>Third Party Advertising and Use of Cookies</strong></p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We may work with outside advertisers and other third parties whose products or services are promoted on our Sites. These third parties may also use cookies. In those cases, we advise Users to check the applicable outside privacy policies.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>Exceptions</strong></p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The following are the ONLY exceptions to our general policy with respect to sharing of User information:</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">* We will share information with companies acting as our agents in hosting or otherwise supporting our Site and in supporting our services to Users (e.g. transactional services, customer service, messaging), all of which agree to use it only for the narrow purpose of providing such support, and to keep the information secure and confidential.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">* Also, entities into which our company is merged, or to which our assets, Site or operations have been transferred, will be able to use User personal information under the terms of this privacy policy. Users will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of any such change in ownership or control of User personal information.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">* ShowTown will also disclose User personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">* User should also be aware that certain Courts, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>Security</strong></p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">ShowTown endeavors to protect the security of Users’ personal information, and related information regarding participation, behaviors and choices, for its intended use.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">ShowTown uses secure technology, such as TLS, i.e. Transport Layer Security, to protect sensitive User information. We store User personal information on a secure server, and otherwise use procedures designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>CONTACT US:</strong></p><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">If you have any questions about this privacy policy or privacy practices please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:info@showtown.co">info@showtown.co</a></p>
